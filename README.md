# Sym-Coding-Challenge

solution 1.c - my first attempt at the coding challenge
In solution 1.c file, I have stored the input data in a large character array and then storing the content of that array in a file.
I have also assumed that user stops inputting data by entering ';'
However, I think the input will be restricted by the character array size.

randomTxt.txt - stores the output of solution 1.c

solution 2.c - my second attempt at the coding challenge
In solution 2.c file, I am accepting input data from user character by character and storing into a file simultaneously.
In my opinion, this removes the previous constraint of data size being limited to the character array size.
However, I assume that user stops inputting data by pressing CTRL-Z.

randomTxt1.txt - stores the output of solution 2.c

In both the cases, I have assumed that user will stop inputting data at some moment.
